<p>Road expansion is a complex issue. There are two issue here. One is genuine victim of this and other is people who knowingly or unknowingly build their structure encroaching or not following law.</p>

<p>A law as enacted around 2020BS (forgot exact date) which stated that any structure build near road must leave certain land from the road. Most building that were build didn't follow this law and are now demolished during this expansion process. If someone build their things without following the law, they will regret it later at some point and that time has come for there folks.</p>

<p>The real victim here are people who build their home prior to that law. A proper compensation is necessary so that they can rebuild. The problem however with people receiving compensation is that the amount they are getting is low and not up to market value. Why? Because of tax evasion ... When people sell their property they massively under value property to evade taxes and government source of data for property evaluation is tax records of that area. The valuation done by government is so low that its less that half of what it is actually worth. So, there is compensation issue as well.
</p>
<p>Its a complex issue with not easy resolution.</p>
